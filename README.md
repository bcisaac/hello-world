# hello-world
here lies Isaac's ideas and resources as well as things he'd be happy to discuss

Hello, I'm Isaac. I study computer science and communication studies at Northwestern University. I'm currently especially interested in algorithmic bias, moderating online platforms, and regulation in the tech industry -- but more simply, I love to think about how individuals interact with technology, and I want to better this relationship. As of now, I'm working to develop my understanding and skills surrounding machine learning.
